_**Notes for TA's:**_ I am using **react-redux** for this assignment. The file organization should be pretty straightforward, but I've outlined the requirements for task 2 below as requested by the spec

* **1 Container:** see [/src/containers]() for containers for '{Clear/Roll}DiceButton[s]' the 'SumShower', and the 'DiceContainer' files.
* **1 Action:** see [/src/actions]() for 'addRollAction' and 'clearRollsAction' files.
* **1 Reducer:** see [/src/reducers]() for a combined 'reducer', as well as 'rollResultReducer' and 'rollSumReducer' files.
